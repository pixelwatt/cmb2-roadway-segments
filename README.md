This plugin adds a new CMB2 fieldtype for drawing roadway segments onto a map and provides a shortcode for display.

![In Action](https://pixelwatt.com/assets/snapmap.gif)

## Description

This plugin extends CMB2 by adding a new fieldtype called 'snapmap' that allows the user to highlight segments of roadway using Google's snap-to-road API. It also allows the user to drop a map pin in the same field. This data can then be displayed on the front-end using the `[snapmap]` shortcode.

This plugin requires CMB2 and a Google Maps API key.

The Google Maps API key must have access to the following APIs:
* Google Maps JavaScript API
* Google Maps Roads API
* Google Places API Web Service 

### Features

* Allows developers to integrate Google Maps with Wordpress via CMB2.
* Allows site admins to provide custom maps styles and specify which map controls to include on the front-end.
* Provides an option to exclude the Google Maps JS API if already loaded.

### Usage

[Visit the wiki](https://github.com/pixelwatt/cmb2-roadway-segments/wiki) for documentation about adding the field to CMB2 and displaying maps on your site.

## Changelog

### 0.9.81

Added the capability of attaching content to the map by CSS ID using the snapmap_build_single() function.

### 0.9.8

Added the capability to display multiple maps on one page using the snapmap_build_single() function by passing a unique ID for additional maps.

### 0.9.71

Added the ability to enable the terrain overlay for maps generated by the snapmap_build_single() function.

### 0.9.7

* Added support for including retina map markers when using the snapmap_build_single() function. This is accomplished by including $marker['scaledSize']

### 0.9.61

GeoJSON copy-and-paste:
* Added a field to paste raw geojson type / coordinate data into (under the Tools panel below the map). If the data type is LineString, pasted data will automatically be converted into a Google Maps compatiable JSON array and overwrite the polyline (Roadway Segment) field value. This functionality will be extended to other geometry types for the 0.9.7 release.

### 0.9.6

* Added fallbacks for tooltips. When being used for a single post, the title of the post containing the pin is displayed in the tooltip. When using queries, the post title followed by a link to the post is displayed.

### 0.9.5

* Added the ability to draw polygons on the map when the "limit_drawing" argument is not set. As a result, the geometry library is now required.
* Modified circle stroke and fill lables to reflect the inclusion of polygons.
* Fixed missing fill and stoke variables in output functions.
* Fixed a bug that prevented polylines, polygons, and circles from being rendered on query-based maps.

### 0.9.4
* Added the ability to draw circles on the map when the "limit_drawing" argument is not set
* Added fields to specify circle stroke and fill colors to the plugin's settings page
* Fixed invalid use of array keys in the shortcode function

### 0.9.3
* Added new 'disable_snap' field argument. When used, the snapToRoads API will not be called when drawing polylines
* Wrapped conditionals using the limit_drawing array key with isset() to ensure that the editor correctly renders

### 0.9.2
* Fixed invalid use of array keys

### 0.9.0
* Initial release.
